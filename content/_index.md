# About Us

## Daniel Esteban Perez

I am a fourth year systems engineering student at the National University of Colombia, I like to study data structures and algorithms.

I like to take advantage of my time to travel, eat, look at the sky and study.

You could see some of my projects on my [github](https://github.com/danperezma).


## Nicol√°s Valderrama Solano *(nivalderramas)*

I am a passionate about computing since I was a kid. I started my B,sc in computing and systems engineering at National University of Colombia four years ago and troughout this time I've got interested in technical aspects such as opreative systems, algoritmhs and data structures. I like to thinks about how technology can reshape society and our day to day (which most times may not be related to technology). Currently I'm looking for expanding my knowledge and skills.
