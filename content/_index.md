## Nicolás Valderrama Solano *(nivalderramas)*

I am a passionate about computing since I was a kid. I started my B,sc in computing and systems engineering at National University of Colombia four years ago and troughout this time I've got interested in technical aspects such as opreative systems, algoritmhs and data structures. I like to thinks about how technology can reshape society and our day to day (which most times may not be related to technology). Currently I'm looking for expanding my knowledge and skills.
