## Background
The Frisén’s Lazy Shadow illusion is a visual illusion that occurs when a shadow is cast on a surface that is not parallel to the observer. It is named after the Swedish psychologist Carl Gustav Frisén.

The illusion occurs because the observer’s brain tries to adjust the shadow to the surface. The observer’s brain expects the shadow to be parallel to the surface, but the shadow is not parallel to the surface. The observer’s brain tries to adjust the shadow to the surface, and the result is the illusion.

## Results
In this case we use a white scuare to simulate the surface and a blue square to simulate the shadow. The shadow is not parallel to the surface(it can be modify using the Compensate slider), but the observer’s brain tries to adjust the shadow to the surface(consecuence of the speed), and the result is the illusion. 

To see the the descompensation of the shadow, you can use the button stop or check the box "Light Background".
## Conclusions
Is very interesting the way that the brain tries to adjust the shadow to the surface, and the result is the illusion. The speed of the adjustment is very important, because if the speed is very slow, the observer’s brain can’t adjust the shadow to the surface, and the result is not the illusion. 

Other important fact is that when the movement is suddenly stopped you can see for a moment that the scuares moves in the opposite direction, and then the brain adjust the shadow to the surface, and the result is the illusion.
