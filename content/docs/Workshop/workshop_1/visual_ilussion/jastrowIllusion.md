## Background

Jastrow's optical illusion was discovered in 1889 by the American psychologist Joseph Jastrow. This illusion misleads us into believing that one of the figures presented is larger than the other, when in fact both are the same size.

The base of the illusion is put the second figure's top right corner aligned whit the first figure's bottom right corner, after that the observer's brain tries to adjust the second figure to the first figure, and the result is the illusion making it look like the second figure is larger than the first figure when in fact both are the same size.

## Results

In this case we use two puzzle pieces to simulate the figures. The second figure's top right corner is aligned whit the first figure's bottom right corner, and after a time the figures moves in diagonal direction showing that both are the same size.

Of this way is shown how the relative position of the second figure to the first figure is that creates the illusion that the second figure is apparently larger than the first figure.

## Conclusions

The mos important thing is how the breain tries to make sense at the relative position of the second figure to the first figure, and make as think that the second figure is apparently larger than the first figure. 

This is a very interesting illusion, because it is very simple, but it is very effective. It show as how our brain works, and how it tries to make sense at the world around us and how it sometimes tricks us.
