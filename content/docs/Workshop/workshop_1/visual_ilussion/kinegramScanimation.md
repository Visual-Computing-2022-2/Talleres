## Background
The Kinegram (“Scanimation”) is a visual illusion that was created in the late 1890s. This illusion consists of placing an image and then moving a black grid with narrow slits from side to side, making it appear as if the image is moving. 

For the illusion to work it is required to create frames of the image to move, and then make assumptions of these frames, then when the grid passes the empty spaces will remain at the same frame and when you keep moving the image will be moving by frames and giving the illusion that the image is moving.

## Results
The first illusion is an image of a pacman, it makes it look like he is eating the balls and the balls are moving towards pacman, for both illusions the grid moves from right to left and when it reaches the right edge the grid starts to move back.

The second illusion is a kinegram created by us, this consists of a circle in which the colors are exchanged, in total consists of only 3 frames and the grid moves in the same way as the first illusion, the following shows the three frames created.

## Conclusions
It is very interesting to see how with just a grid you can create images with movement. It is important to keep in mind that depending on the number of frames we have and the width we have given to our frame so will make our grid. The more frames we have, the wider each black part of the grid will be. The wider the frames the wider the white part of the grid will be. Another thing to keep in mind is that the width of the frames must be the same. 

It is important that the movement is cyclical, so that there are no jumps in the sequence we want to show.
