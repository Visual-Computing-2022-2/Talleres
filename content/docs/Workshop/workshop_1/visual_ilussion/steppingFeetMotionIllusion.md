## Background
The "Stepping feet” Motion Illusion is a visual illusion. This illusion makes it seem that objects move fast or slow depending on background but what happens is the objects move a constant velocity. The first described of the illusion is by Stuart Anstis.

For the illusion to work, the luminance of the objects have to be different, for example the red and blue. Further the background
also have to be different luminance, the best example of background is black and white. Because of the contrast of the objects with the background it is perceived that objects move fast or slow.

## Results
In this case we use the background line black and white interspersed. And the colors square is yellow and blue, the objects move from left to right and when it reaches the right edge the square begin to return to the left edge. 

To see the objects without the background you can press any key.

## Conclusions
Is very interesting see that luminance of the objects and the contrast with the background affects the perception of the movement. It's very important to add that the width of the square and the background affect the illusion. For example, if the width from separation of the color black in very short the illusion don't work,this is because there is very little time in the contrast when it passes through the white color.
